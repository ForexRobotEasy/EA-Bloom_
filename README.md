## Description

EA Bloom is a virtual orders Expert Advisor that uses indicator signals to open and manage trades in the MetaTrader platform. It allows users to set parameters such as take profit, stop loss, trailing stop, and breakeven to customize their trading strategy.

The Expert Advisor works by interacting with an indicator to determine the entry point for trades. It opens virtual orders based on the calculated entry point and converts them to real orders when certain conditions are met. It also applies various trading functions such as take profit, stop loss, trailing stop, and breakeven to manage the open orders.

The code includes inputs for the user to customize the Expert Advisor's behavior, such as setting the take profit in pips, stop loss as a percentage of account balance, trailing stop in pips, and breakeven function parameters.

## Inputs

- TakeProfit: The desired take profit level in pips.
- StopLossPercentage: The stop loss level as a percentage of the account balance.
- TrailingStop: The trailing stop level in pips.
- BreakevenEnabled: Enable or disable the breakeven function.
- BreakevenPips: The number of pips to move the stop loss to breakeven.

## Virtual Orders

The Expert Advisor uses a virtual orders structure to keep track of open orders that have not yet been converted to real orders. When a new entry point is determined by the indicator, a virtual order is opened. Once the conditions are met, the virtual order is converted to a real order in the MetaTrader platform.

## Indicator Interaction

The GetEntryPoint function is responsible for calculating the entry point based on the indicator's logic. Users can customize this function to implement their desired indicator strategy. The calculated entry point is then used to open virtual orders.

## OnTick Event Handler

The OnTick function is the event handler that is called on each tick of the price feed. It checks for new entry points and opens virtual orders accordingly. It also checks existing virtual orders for the conditions to convert them to real orders. Additionally, it applies various trading functions such as take profit, stop loss, trailing stop, and breakeven to manage the open orders.

## OnInit Event Handler

The OnInit function is the event handler that is called when the Expert Advisor is initialized. This is where necessary parameters and indicators can be set. Users can customize this function to set any additional parameters or indicators required for their trading strategy.

## OnDeinit Event Handler

The OnDeinit function is the event handler that is called when the Expert Advisor is deinitialized. It clears the virtual orders array to reset the Expert Advisor's state.
